CLIENT TIER (Port 3000):
• React SPA with component-based UI
• Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
• Lucide React for modern icons
• React Router for navigation

SERVER TIER (Port 5000):
• Express.js RESTful API
• Morgan logging middleware
• Helmet security headers
• CORS cross-origin support

DATA TIER:

• GET /api/recipes/random/:count - Random recipes
• GET /api/recipes/meta/tags - Available tags

Meal Plan Management:
• GET /api/meal-plans - All meal plans
• POST /api/meal-plans - Create meal plan
• PUT /api/meal-plans/:id - Update meal plan
• DELETE /api/meal-plans/:id - Delete meal plan

Query Parameters:
search, maxTotalTime, maxPrepTime, diet, difficulty, tags, limit

=== SLIDE 10: CHANGES FROM PROPOSAL ===
Strategic Decisions:

Original → Final → Reason
MongoDB → JSON Files → Simplified deployment, no dependencies
User Auth → No Account → Faster onboarding, less complexity
Recipe Reviews → Curated Content → Quality over quantity
Shopping Cart → Export List → MVP approach, scope management
Real-time Collab → Individual Plans → Phase 2 timeline

Benefits:
• Faster development with reduced technical debt
• Easier deployment with self-contained application
• Better user experience with immediate access
• Maintainable codebase with simpler architecture
• Comprehensive testing (78 tests, 100% passing)

=== SLIDE 11: TESTING & QUALITY ===
Comprehensive Test Coverage:

Backend Testing (38 tests):
• API endpoint functionality
• Error handling and edge cases
• Data validation and filtering
• CRUD operations for meal plans

Frontend Testing (40 tests):
• Component rendering
• User interaction flows
• Routing and navigation
• Mock API integration

Total: 78 Tests - 100% Passing
Technologies: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest

=== PRESENTATION NOTES ===
Screenshots needed:
