- Quick filters like "5-ingredient meals" or "vegan dinners under 30 minutes"
- Weekly meal planning with intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- No account required - start using immediately
- Mobile-first responsive design for all devices

### Slide 3: Architecture Diagram

**Three-Tier Architecture:**

**Client Tier (Frontend):**

- React SPA running on port 3000
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- React Router for navigation

**Server Tier (Backend):**

- Express.js API server on port 5000
- Morgan middleware for logging
- Helmet for security headers
- CORS for cross-origin requests

**Data Tier:**

- JSON file storage (recipes.json, meal-plans.json)
- File system I/O operations
- Easily upgradeable to database

**Communication:** HTTP/REST API between tiers

### Slide 9: API Design & Data Flow

**RESTful API Endpoints:**

**Recipe Management:**

- GET /api/recipes - Retrieve all recipes with optional filtering
- GET /api/recipes/:id - Get specific recipe details
- GET /api/recipes/random/:count - Fetch random recipes for discovery
- GET /api/recipes/meta/tags - Get all available recipe tags

**Meal Plan Management:**

- GET /api/meal-plans - Retrieve all user meal plans
- POST /api/meal-plans - Create new meal plan
- PUT /api/meal-plans/:id - Update existing meal plan
- DELETE /api/meal-plans/:id - Remove meal plan

**Query Parameters for Advanced Filtering:**
search, maxTotalTime, maxPrepTime, diet, difficulty, tags, limit

### Slide 10: Changes from Initial Proposal

**Strategic Decisions and Rationale:**

| Original Proposal | Final Implementation | Reason for Change |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| MongoDB Database | JSON File Storage | Simplified deployment, no external dependencies |
| User Authentication System | No Account Required | Faster user onboarding, reduced complexity |
| Recipe Ratings & Reviews | Curated Recipe Content | Focus on quality over quantity |
| Shopping Cart Integration | Export Grocery List | MVP approach, avoid external API complexity |
| Real-time Collaboration | Individual Meal Plans | Scope management for Phase 2 timeline |

**Benefits of These Changes:**

- Faster development cycle with reduced technical debt
- Easier deployment process with self-contained application
- Improved user experience with immediate access
- More maintainable codebase with simpler architecture
- Better testing coverage with fewer moving parts
